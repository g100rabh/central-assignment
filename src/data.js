  description: `
  Hello! I'm Saurabh Gupta, a passionate Software Engineer with a strong background in frontend and backend development. 
  I have a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Civil Engineering from Technocrats Institute of Technology, where I graduated with an 8.2 GPA.

  Currently, I'm working at Codecaffiene Technologies Pvt Ltd. as a Software Engineer. In this role, I spearheaded the implementation of modern frontend libraries and tools such as Redux and Tailwind, leading to a 30% improvement in application performance and scalability. 
  I have collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver over 15 features, bug fixes, and improvements, consistently meeting project deadlines.

  My previous experience includes working as an Associate Software Engineer at Accenture. There, I optimized JIT production stages for the IJCore project, reducing production time by 25%, and designed user-friendly interfaces with React and ASP.NET, which increased user satisfaction by 40%.

  I have strong skills in various programming languages, frameworks, and tools such as JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, Prisma, and many others. I am also proficient in optimizing data systems and implementing robust authentication systems to enhance user security.

  Besides my technical skills, I am committed to continuous learning and improvement, having solved over 150 LeetCode questions. I qualified for the Gate Civil Engineering exams in both 2020 and 2021.
